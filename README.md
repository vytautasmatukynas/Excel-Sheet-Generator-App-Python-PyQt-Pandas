# Excel Sheet Generator App

I created this app basically for generating sheets for pallet content info, that i won't have to write everything by 
hand from main excel.

This app generates excel file with seperate sheets from main excel file. It searches for column "column_name" with 
numbers or names, sorts that column and splits it in several tables, then puts everything to new excel file and creates 
sheets.

### Prepare:

Select file:
